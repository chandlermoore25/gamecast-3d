GameCast 3D â€” Unified Engine Patches (2025-08-22)

Fixes included:
1) Boot gating so engine waits for THREE.js, GLTFLoader, and DOM before starting.
2) Added THREE.Clock() to engine; fixed render loop crash (getDelta on undefined).
3) Improved waitForGameEngine() on index.html to avoid race/half-baked API call.
4) Load Games now tolerates missing 'btn' arg and sets backend before fetch.
5) Strike zone canvas created automatically; heat map renders in Play/Stream.
6) Three r128 compatibility: uses renderer.outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding.
7) GLB path probing prefers /frontend/models first, falls back gracefully.
